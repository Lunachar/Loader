#  Unity Interaction game  

A simple yet effective item interaction game for Unity that allows players to:  
✅ Pick up items  
✅ Swap held items  
✅ Drop items when needed  

Works on both **PC and mobile devices**.  

## Features  

- **Pick Up & Swap System**: Automatically pick up items when looking at them and swap held items when interacting with a new object.  
- **Drop Mechanic**: Allows players to drop held items if they are not targeting any interactable object.  
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works with both **keyboard/mouse** and **touch controls** for mobile devices.  
- **Raycast-Based Detection**: Ensures precise interactions by checking for objects in front of the player.  
- **Zenject Dependency Injection**: The project utilizes **Zenject** for better code organization and dependency management, making it more scalable and modular.  

##  How to Use  

1. **Pick Up an Item**: Look at an item and press the interaction button.  
2. **Swap Items**: If you already hold an item, interacting with another will replace it.  
3. **Drop Items**: If no interactable object is targeted, pressing the button will drop the held item.  

##  Requirements  

- Unity **2021.3 LTS** or later  
- **Zenject** package installed
